## How to run
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```git bash
    git clone https://github.com/Remmold/wow-assistant.git
2. **Navigate to the project root:**
    ```git bash
    cd https://github.com/Remmold/wow-assistant.git
3. **Create virtual environment (with `uv venv`):**
    ```git bash
    uv venv .venv
4. **Activate virtual environment:**
    ```git bash
    .venv\scripts\activate (Windows)
    OR
    source source .venv/bin/activate (MacOS/Linux)
5. **Install dependencies from the `requirements.lock`-file:**
    ```git bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.lock.txt
6. **Run the file `pipeline.py` to run the pipeline**
    > ⚠️ Do note that this process will take some time - the first pipeline-run will fetch **a lot** of data, and could take a bit over an hour.
    (a preview mode is to be added, for faster data fetching)
7. **Run the Streamlit Dashboard with the following command (from project root):**
    ```git bash
    streamlit run app.py
